## Admin

### Design

Always do mobile first design.

### Structure

- Use `src/components/admin` for UI components that are integrated with react-admin.
- Use `src/components/apps` for UI related with apps.
- use `src/components/shared` for UI only components that are don't have any react-admin integration.

### Components

- Use shadcn/ui for components.
- Use lucide for icons.
- Use react-admin for data provider.
- Use react-router for routing.
- Use react-hook-form for form handling.
- Use `cn` for class name composition.

### Components Specifics

- For `copy` buttons, use `toast` for success and error messages.

### Docs

Make sure to use React Admin [docs](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/documentation.html) for all the components.

### IMPORTANT NOTES

- Always use absolute imports - `@/components/apps/logs-utils` instead of `./logs-utils`.
- Common types between backend and Admin should be in `@appdotbuild/core` package.
