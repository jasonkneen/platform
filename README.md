# app.build (platform)

**app.build** is an open-source AI agent for generating production-ready full-stack applications from a single prompt.

## What's in this repository

This platform repository contains the infrastructure that powers app.build:

- **CLI** - Command-line interface accessible via `npx @app.build/cli`
- **Control plane** - Backend platform managing communication between CLI and agent
- **Deployment pipeline** - Orchestrates application generation and deployment to live URLs

![Architecture of CLI->platform->agent](./readme-docs/architecture_diagram.png)

## Architecture

The platform acts as the orchestration layer between user interfaces and the code generation agent:

1. **CLI receives** user prompts and project requirements
2. **Control plane coordinates** with the agent for code generation
3. **Platform manages** database provisioning, testing, and deployment
4. **Applications deploy** to live URLs with full CI/CD

The actual code generation agent is available in the [agent repository](https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent).

## Try it

```bash
npx @app.build/cli
```
